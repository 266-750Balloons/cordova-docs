Overview
========

Cordova is an open-source mobile development framework. It allows you
to use standard web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
for cross-platform development, avoiding each mobile platforms' native
development language.  Applications execute as a WebView within a
native wrapper, and rely on standards-compliant Cordova API bindings
to access the device's sensors, data, and network status.

Cordova also offers features

PhoneGap is a product offering that relies on the Cordova framework.
Its PhoneGap Build service provides a way to build applications
remotely without having to run local tools.

Use Cordova if you are:

* a mobile developer and want to extend an application across more
  than one platform, without having to re-implement it with each
  platform's language and tool set.

* a web developer and want to deploy a web app that's packaged for
  distribution in app store portals.

* a developer who wants to blend
