Platform Guides
======================

Before developing for any of the platforms listed below, install
cordova's command-line interface (CLI).
(For details, see The Cordova Command-line Interface.)

To develop Cordova applications, you must install SDKs for each mobile
platform you are targeting. This installation is necessary regardless
of whether you do the majority of your work in the SDK or use the CLI
for your build cycle.

Each platform guide listed below tells you what you need to know to
set up each development environment: where to obtain the SDK, how to
set up device emulators, how to connect devices for direct testing,
and managing signing key requirements.  Additional guides provide
information on each platform's available configuration settings,
instructions to add plugins, how to upgrade each platform, and
platform-specific command-line tools that serve as an alternative to
the `cordova` command-line tool.
