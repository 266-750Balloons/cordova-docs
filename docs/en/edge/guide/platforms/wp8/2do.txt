Install problems:

- install which SDK for WP? Both __Windows Phone__ and __Ultimate
  2013__ versions, failed at `cordova platform add wp8` stage:
  complains latest version is not installed. Requires clean install?

- VMware doesn't recognize ISO's Win8 component.

- virtualBox doesn't work yet; any config info?


Queries:

- assume no xtra parallels requirements for win8?

- assume no extra win8 VMware req's for win8? 


Other:

- can we easily discuss wp7 within wp8 topic?

- check location of cordova wp8 dir

- how to open WP SDK to modify project

- check location of locally generated src files

- check if CL debug/release build flags are available

- can you configure WP emulator to choose different devices?

- check if run's emulator flag works for WP shell tools

- any WP app signing procedure other than registration?
